# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of the analysis is to study Amazon reviews written by people of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that provides sellers reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small amount to Amazon and give products to Amazon Vine members. Then the members publish a review of the product. The reviews of the Vine members will be compared to reviews by non-Vine members to look at trends in ratings in one specific product area. For this project, the chosen dataset is video game reviews.

## Results 
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support:

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?


## Summary

### State if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement.

### Provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
